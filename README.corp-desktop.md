# Belongs to `config.corp-desktop` branch.

This set of files belong to a machine-local branch.

Any changes made to it belong to my corp desktop. Most relevant files
are directly used as config files via symlinks.

This branch corresponds to the same-named remote branch.

The directory where these files are should _never check out
other branches_. 

Merge and cherry-pick with caution.

_All non-public stuff is factored away_, and should remain so.
